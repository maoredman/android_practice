Hi, my name is Thomas.

\n\nI am learning how to write Android apps in Kotlin.
\nThis app is a small practice project that\'s part of an online course on Udacity.

\n\nWhen I\'m not learning Kotlin, I write programs in Python, Javascript and C++.

\n\nI love brewing nice coffee, and make a cup of latte every morning using freshly-ground beans.
\nDuring the weekend, I practice pouring latte art :D
\nRecently, I am also learning how to brew pour-over specialty coffee using the "4:6 method",
a brewing technique which won first place in the 2016 World Brewers Cup.

\n\nNice to meet you!\n
