# android_practice

A collection of apps I wrote for the [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) online course  on Udacity.

* [DiceRoller](#DiceRoller): a six-face die which can be rolled by clicking a button
* [AboutMe](#AboutMe): displays configurable text and a scrollable personal bio
* [ColorMyView](#ColorMyView): boxes that change color when clicked or when buttons are pressed

Things I did:
* Installed APKs on devices both real and emulated
* Learned about components of an Android app, such as activities, layouts, drawables, string values, Gradle build files and namespaces
* Used `lateinit` to improve performance by avoiding repetitive calls to `findViewById`
* Learned some basics on backward compatibility

## AboutMe
Displays configurable text and a scrollable personal bio

Things I did:
* Learned to use Android Studio's Layout Editor to create views (`TextView`, `ScrollView`, `ImageView`, `EditText`)
* Set view attributes and extracted styles for reusability
* Used data binding to improve performance

## ColorMyView
Boxes that change color when clicked or when buttons are pressed

Things I did:
* Learned to create contraints, ratios, bias, chains and baselines to adapt to different screen configurations
