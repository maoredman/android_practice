# android_practice

A collection of apps I wrote for the [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) online course  on Udacity.

Things I did:
* Installed APKs on devices both real and emulated
* Learned about components of an Android app, such as activities, layouts, drawables, string values, Gradle build files and namespaces
* Used `lateinit` to improve performance by avoiding repetitive calls to `findViewById`
* Learned some basics on backward compatibility
